# Malaria detection
CNN model that predicts traces of malaria parasitized cells in a thin blood smear in an image, reducing the burden to microscopists in resource-constrained regions.

The following steps need to be followed to start the project. 
- Download the images from source(https://www.kaggle.com/iarunava/cell-images-for-detecting-malaria) 
- Save it on you loacal machine -open the python file which is present. 
- Change the path in the program to the orginal path where you have saved the images.
